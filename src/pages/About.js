        Hi, I'm Breia Swanigan, a 22-year-old self-taught Front End Developer with advanced skills in HTML, CSS (Grid, Flexbox, and Animations), JavaScript, ReactJS, and Git. Since 2019, I've worked on diverse projects from static websites to complex web applications. I'm also enhancing my expertise in NodeJs and UX/UI design, with a growing interest in SQL. Outside of coding, I enjoy working out, playing the piano, and binge-watching TV series. I'm always eager to learn and grow, whether through open-source projects, new technologies, or online courses. Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out to collaborate!
