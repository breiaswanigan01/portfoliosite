      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Hi, I'm Breia Swanigan, a 22-year-old self-taught Front End Developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional web applications. I began my journey in front end development in 2019, and over the years, I have honed my skills to an advanced level in various technologies including HTML, CSS (Grid, Flexbox, and Animations), JavaScript, ReactJS, and Git.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I am currently enhancing my expertise in NodeJs and UX/UI design, and I have a budding interest in SQL. My diverse skill set allows me to tackle a wide range of projects, from simple static websites to complex web applications.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        When I'm not coding, you can find me working out, playing the piano, or binge-watching my favorite TV series. I believe in a balanced lifestyle that keeps both my mind and body active and healthy.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. Whether it's collaborating on open-source projects, experimenting with new technologies, or taking online courses, I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you'd like to work together or just want to connect. Let's create something amazing!
